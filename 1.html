  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110405/" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">Continuum mechanics</a> consists of the compatibility for strain and displacement, the equilibrium for stress
  and force, and the constitutive law for strain and stress. The compatibility relation is based on geometry, and the
  equilibrium equation is derived from Newtonâ€™s laws of motion. So that there are no uncertainty or error in two
  equations. In contrast, the constitutive equation is a formulation obtained from the observations and the
  experiments, which inevitability involves the uncertainty.</p>

  Hyperelastic material is a type of constitutive model for ideal elastic material of which the stress-strain
  relationship derives from a strain energy density function. Over the decades, many hyperplastic models have been
  proposed to consider large deformation for rubberlike materials [1-5]. Those functions have material constants to
  be determined from experimental data. Classical hyperealstic model represents test data well only for certain
  levels of strains, and hardly for other conditions. Obtaining from observations and experiments, it is fundamentally
  impossible to construct a model that perfectly simulates the behavior of materials.
