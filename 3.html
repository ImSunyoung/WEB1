  <h1>3. Classical hyperelastic modeling for crystal structures</h1>

  <p>
    Hyperelastic is the constitutive relation for ideally elastic material where the stress-strain relationship derived
  from a strain energy density function. A strain energy density function is a function of strain, and the stress is
  obtained by differentiating it with respect to strain. For isotropic materials, the constitutive relation is the same
  regardless of the selected coordinate systems. So that a lot of the strain energy density functions have been studied
  for isotropic materials using the invariants of strain tensor such as Neo-Hookean, Mooney-Rivlin, and polynomial
  models.</p>
